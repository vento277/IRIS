# IRIS | Python based personal assistant

Iris is my personal AI assistant developed using python. It is meant to automate my daily routines such as announcing my schedules, playing certain music, and turning on/off lights upon sunrise and sunset. The code is not aimed to work in any environment, but with a little tweaking, one should be able to. 

## Iris | Gen 1

The 1st generation (AUG 2021) can be found in a separate folder.

## Iris | Gen 2

Second attempt to develop my personal assistant. It consists of multiple python files with integrated function calls. Vosk (offline) and Microsoft Azure Speech API are used for its STT & TTS.

A **virtual audio cable** is used to allow multiple I/O from a local operating system.
