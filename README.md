# IRIS
Iris is a virtual assistant software built to make my life more productive.

## Problem
There are many virtual assistants in the market such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. However, for most users, the assistants usually carry out a limited number of tasks that don't require a high degree of performance. These tasks include:
- Light Switching
- Checking Weather
- Searching
- Timers
- Scheduling an Event
- etc...

In my view, the superior performance from a cloud-based TTS & STT doesn't outweigh the privacy concerns for now. The tipping point will be when the assistants become capable of conversing with the user, therefore, providing the actual assistant experience, rather than simply executing tasks via voice commands.

Also, a platform-based assistant often forces one to use local applications. For example, to use Google Calendar in Siri, one must sync it with the iCalendar.

Until the technology for LLMs advances such that all assistants act both as a agent for tasks and human connections, the difference between a keyword-based assistant and a more advanced one will remain marginal.

## Solution
A local, customizable, keyword-based assistant.
